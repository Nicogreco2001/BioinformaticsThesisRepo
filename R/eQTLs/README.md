# Script Description

**GTEx_eQTLs.R**: This R script imports and processes data from the GTEx project's eQTL dataset. 
It reads in the relevant files containing eQTL data and the snp annotations for the specific lncRNAs of interest. 
The script then matches eQTLs with the snp annotations based on their variant IDs and creates a merged dataset for further analysis.
