#### CODE FOLDERS
This repository contains the code and data used for my bachelor's degree thesis in bioinformatics. The thesis focuses on exploring the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in medulloblastoma (MB), a malignant brain tumor primarily affecting children worldwide.

## Folders

- **dbSNP**: Contains the scripts used for processing and analyzing genetic data downloaded from the dbSNP database. The code includes filtering, organizing, and creating plots related to known polymorphisms within a region of interest close to the genetic coordinates of three specific lncRNAs.

- **eQTLs**: This folder contains the code for extracting and analyzing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. The code includes filtering the eQTLs datasets, identifying relevant variants within the lncRNAs loci, and performing statistical analysis to gain insights about variation-gene associations.

- **StructurePrediction**: Here, you can find the scripts used for predicting the secondary structure of the lncRNA transcript. The code utilizes RNAfold
