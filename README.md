üëã Welcome to the repository for my bachelor's degree thesis on the topic of "Decoding the function of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Subgroup 3 Medulloblastoma: Integrative SNP and eQTL Analysis"! In this project, I used a bioinformatics pipeline to investigate the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor primarily affecting children worldwide. My aim was to gain insight on the regulatory activity of three specific lncRNAs that depend on the MYC oncogene in Medulloblastoma (MB).

üîç To summarize my findings in a visually appealing way, I've included an infographic as a PDF file in this repository. You can view it directly below:

üìÑ To get a comprehensive understanding of my research, take a moment to read my full thesis, available [here]([link_to_thesis](https://github.com/Nicogreco2001/BioinformaticsThesisRepo/blob/main/Tesi%20Finished.pdf)). The thesis delves into the fascinating connections between lncRNAs, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and nearby genes. I also reveal the effects of genetic variations on the function and stability of the lncMB1 RNA molecule.

‚ú® Feel free to explore the repository and dive into the code I've developed to analyze the data. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I appreciate your interest in my research and hope you find it intriguing!

üåü Enjoy exploring and thank you for your support!
